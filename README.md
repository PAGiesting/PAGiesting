I solve problems creatively.

I tell a story with pictures and words to explain the solution.

I'm fascinated by atoms and chemistry, geometry and calculus, coding and algorithms, and the way human beings work, fail, and flourish.

### Materials science: 
My goal is to work where chemistry and symmetry, quantum properties, and electromagnetism meet. (Shown: prospective model of an ST1 diamond defect, a room temperature single photon emitter.)

### Geoscience:
I have years of experience examining, diagnosing, and solving problems in geochemical research and geological consulting. (Shown: inverse distance weighted model of TCE distribution in soil constructed in R.)

### Data science:
I process data and information by any and every means, and always have. I specialize in generalism... but particularly in unsupervised learning and letting the data speak to me. (Shown: false color image of Kilauea and environs constructed by PCA on Landsat 8 data.)
